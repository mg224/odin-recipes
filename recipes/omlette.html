    <h3>Description</h3>    
    <p>In college, I often ate omelettes for breakfast lunch and dinner (thank you, cafeteria omelette station). Now, I eat eggs at all times of the day in many forms (like egg muffins, egg casserole, egg sandwiches and this frittata recipe)! There’s nothing more filling, delicious and nutritious than a protein-packed omelet, any time of the day.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil: To coat the pan you can use olive oil, avocado oil, butter, ghee, or my personal favorite – bacon grease!</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper: A pinch of kosher salt does wonderful things for the egg mixture – from seasoning the eggs just right to creating an even fluffier texture.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Just 2 large eggs are needed for cooking up the perfect omelette with an 8-inch pan. If you’ve got a 10-inch pan, 3 eggs are ideal.</li>
        <li>Filling: The world is your oyster when it comes to omelette fillings! My go-to is a bell pepper, spinach combo with a sprinkle of microgreens on top. But I’ve got tons more deliciously savory ideas listed out below.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Saute the filling. Before you actually make the omelette, you’ll need to saute your choice of filling (I’ve listed out options below). Then set the filling aside on a separate plate.</li>
       <li>Make the egg base. Whisk the eggs, salt and pepper in a medium bowl until lightly fluffy. And if you’re wondering why you should salt beforehand – I’ve got a quick explanation down below!</li>
       <li>Cook the omelette base. The key to the perfect omelette is cooking low and slow! So heat the oil or butter over medium-low heat, then pour the egg mixture into an even layer. Turn the heat to low, and let it cook without poking or prodding for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
       <li>Add in the good stuff. Pile the filling onto one side of the omelette. Then gently fold the other half over and slowly slide the omelette onto a plate. Breakfast is served!</li>
