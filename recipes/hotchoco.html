    <h3>Description</h3>    
    <p>Cozy up with a hot mug of hot chocolate this winter. This hot chocolate recipe is incredibly rich, creamy, and oh-so satisfying. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar and cocoa powder: This sweet and creamy hot cocoa starts with white sugar and unsweetened cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the chocolatey flavor, but it won't make your hot cocoa taste salty.</li>
        <li>Water: Pour boiling water over the sugar, cocoa powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Milk: You can use whole, 2 percent, or the alternative milk of your choice.</li>
        <li>Vanilla: A dash of vanilla takes the decadent flavor over the top.</li>
        <li>Half-and-half: Half-and-half is added after the hot chocolate is poured into the mugs, creating a rich texture and cooling the cocoa to a drinkable temperature.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the dry ingredients in a pan, then whisk in the boiling water. </li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring constantly, for two minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the milk, remove from the heat, and stir in the vanilla.</li>
        <li>Pour the hot cocoa into mugs and finish with half-and-half.</li>
    </ol>
